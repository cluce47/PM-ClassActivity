x respresnts the time of the slower train
y represents the time of the faster train
 y= x-1
x= 1.5y 
 create a system of equations and solve for time 
 //y=1.5y-1
//0.5y=1
//y=2
 //x=1.5(2)
//x=3 
 //create float varaible x and set equal to 3 and create float variable y and set equal to 2 
print "The slower train takes" + x + " seconds and the faster train takes " + y " seconds."
