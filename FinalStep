In your current branch, review ALL the materials/deliverables contained.
Do NOT edit any documents, but create a NEW file that will explain, comment and/or mention:
a. if the final product actually solves the original problem and why do you think so
b. is the "application" ready to be released?
c. list any changes that were made (which files were edited?)
d. were there any problems, successes and any next steps (for maintenance)
e. is it user friendly?
can it be improved?
there shouldn't be at this point... but is any documentation or comments missing?
