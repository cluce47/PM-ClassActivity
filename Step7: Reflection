They did not answer the question properly, they were missing one of the possible answers. When they wrote the code they only solved for two possible answers, not checking if there were any more. They simply found the first set that worked, and a set that would work on any odd integer. By doing this they missed one answer, and if it were a different odd integer or simply an even integer it would not work to solve it.
