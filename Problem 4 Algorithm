x respresnts the time of the slower train
y represents the time of the faster train

y= x-1
x= 1.5y 

create a system of equations and solve for time 


//y=1.5y-1
//0.5y=1
//y=2

//x=1.5(2)
//x=3 

//create float varaible x and set equal to 3 and create float variable y and set equal to 2 
print "The slower train takes" + x + " seconds and the faster train takes " + y " seconds."
