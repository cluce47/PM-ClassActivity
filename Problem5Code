//This program takes a math question and outputs the answers. It was solved manually, still learning how to make program solvable (by making program factor the standard form equation to vertex form).
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int time= 1;
    int height= 6;
    System.out.println("The max height is " + height + " metres. ");
    System.out.println("The time elapsed is " + time + " second. ");
  }
}
//Would need to have actual solving in code as well
//Having comments for how each step was achieved would make the code more user friendly.
