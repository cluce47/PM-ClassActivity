The code output is correct and fully answers the question, as well as demonstrates to the user how the program actually
went to solve the current problem given. 

The algorithm itself was well detailed anf gave clear instructions to the programmer on what they should do, or at least where they should
start if they were to take a different approach. 

The prototype had to be re-done by the looks of it since the first one, which I believe was made be group 2, was incorrect. 
Good catch by group 8 and well done for fixing it. 

Overall there doesn't seem to be many issues and I would call the program ready for public use since it does it's job efficiently,
quickly, and shows the user what it's doing to solve the equation. Almost acting as a teaching tool in that way.
