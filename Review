Does the program solve the original problem?
  Yes, it solves the original problem by using distance-time-speed formula.
Is it user friendly?
  No, because there aren't any user inputs, so if one wanted to get a new time for distance/speed,
  they would have to edit the code, which is not very user friendly.
should it be relasesed? 
  Definitely not. The code has constant values so if the user wants to solve this same type of problem but with 
  different values the user will have  to go into the physical code to change the values.
