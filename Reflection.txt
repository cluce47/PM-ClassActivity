On final code, having comments to explain what each line is doing would make the code more user friendly to understand. No edits were made to algorithm or prototype. Overall, there were issues where multiple final codes were created, thus causing confusion as to which is the main file. I would most likely not release this to the public due to the sheer amount of confusion throughout the files, and lack of comments on some files. Even though all files were there, it was not presented in a way that people outside of the school would understand.
